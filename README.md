# Monthly-Underemployment_Rate_Forecasting_Project
Developed and benchmarked multiple time series and machine learning models to forecast Australia’s monthly underemployment rate, achieving high-accuracy predictions (RMSE = 0.1288) and translating results into actionable economic insights.

This project forecasts Australia’s monthly underemployment rate (1978–2017) and generates predictions for 2018–2019.
Our goal was to compare the performance of traditional time series models and machine learning methods to identify the most accurate forecasting approach for policy and economic analysis.

The final model, a Transformer-based deep learning approach, achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.1288, significantly outperforming other benchmarks such as SARIMA, Random Forest, and LSTM.
